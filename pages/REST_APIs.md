# REST APIs

[REST (Representational State of
Transfer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
is a lightweight option for developing web services using the HTTP
protocol — a fact which makes it simpler with less overhead than a web
service that uses the SOAP protocol.

When an API follows REST architecture, it is called a REST API. When a
service is designed around a REST standard, it is said to make the
service “RESTful”. The main requirements for a web service to be
considered RESTful are that it must:

-   Have a separate client and server
-   Use HTTP
-   Be stateless

A REST API is made up of a bunch or resources; this is called a resource
model and it makes use of Uniform Resource Identifies (URIs). The URI
syntax allows you to specify a query that returns the information you
want from a REST API. The main elements of a REST system are:

-   Resources are the request from a client of what it wants to get from
    a host — like a web page or a database record.
-   A resource identifier is a URI which names the resource.
-   Representations are when a server sends a response with the resource
    in a finished format

  

At Qantas, Postman and RestAssured are popular automation frameworks
used within Product and Project teams for automating the testing of REST
APIs. The choice of tool is dependent on various factors such as skill,
responsibilities and development stack.
