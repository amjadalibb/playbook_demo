# Handover & Operational Support

It is pivotal with every automation effort that the Operations or DevOps team is able to execute and understand the test results. As such a "Readme" documentation should be created as a mandatory activity to any test automation project.

This **README** file should contains information about automation framework, file structure etc. It also outline a step by step instruction to setup, modify, execute and analyse test results. This is achievable by using a simple plain text file called README, **README**.TXT, **README**.md .

Example :

[README.md](attachments/119669984/119673256.md)

  

As a general checklist, ensure this readme contains at the very least:

-   Bamboo links where the tests are run. 
-   Environments on which the automation tests are run.
-   Document/person explaining the structure of the framework 
-   Domain specific names and files, common files, reporting. 
-   Process explained when the automation tests are run.
-   If manually triggered or automatically. 
-   Any configuration that is needed to be done before running the automated tests. 
-   Tagging.
-   Interpreting the reports to operational staff.
