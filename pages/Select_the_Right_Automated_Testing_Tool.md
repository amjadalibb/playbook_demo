# Select the Right Automated Testing Tool

Selecting an automated testing tool is essential for test automation.
There are a lot of automated testing tools on the market, and it is
important to choose the automated testing tool that best suits your
overall requirements.

Consider these key points when selecting an automated testing tool:

-   Support for your platforms and technology. Are you testing .Net, C\#
    or WPF applications and on what operating systems? Are you going to test web applications? Do you need support for mobil application testing? Do you work with Android or iOS, or do you work with both operating systems?
-   Flexibility for testers of all skill levels. Can your QA department write automated test scripts or is there a need for keyword testing?
-   Feature rich but also easy to create automated tests. Does the automated testing tool support record-and-playback test creation as well as manual creation of automated tests; does it include features for implementing checkpoints to verify values, databases, or key functionality of your application?
-   Create automated tests that are reusable, maintainable and resistant to changes in the applications UI. Will my automated tests break if my UI changes?
