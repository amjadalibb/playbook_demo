# Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery

Continuous integration/Continuous delivery (**CI**/**CD**) Continuous
integration (**CI**) is a software engineering practice where members of
a team integrate their work with increasing frequency. Continuous
delivery (**CD**) is to packaging and deployment what **CI** is to build
and test.

We at Qantas believe in Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
We release our features almost every week.
